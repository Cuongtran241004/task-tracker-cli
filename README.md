# âœ… Task Tracker CLI (https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

A simple, lightweight Task Tracker application implemented in **Java** with a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. This project helps users manage and track their tasks, offering features like adding, updating, viewing, and deleting tasks â€” all while storing data in a local `tasks.json` file. Itâ€™s a great exercise in building CLI tools, working with files, handling user input, and applying OOP design principles (Model, Repository, Service, Exception).

## âœ¨ Features

- **Task Management**: Add, update, delete tasks.
- **Status Tracking**: Mark tasks as `todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved to `tasks.json` between sessions.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: No external libraries used.
- **Formatted Output**: Display tasks clearly in the terminal.
